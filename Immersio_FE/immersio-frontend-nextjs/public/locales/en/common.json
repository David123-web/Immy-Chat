	"faq": {
		"q_1": "How is this platform different from other traditional language programs?",
		"a_1": "Our courses get you listening and then speaking right away. This approach is in line with established and proven SLA (Second Language Acquisition) and CLT (Communicative Language Teaching) methods that are common with modern languages, where repeated, meaningful exposure to “comprehensible input” is the basis for fostering lasting fluency.",
		"q_2": "Why should I learn through conversation if my goal is to read and interpret texts?",
		"a_2": "Because in order to effectively read and interpret texts, you need to acquire an active fluency in the language culture you are trying to understand. There may be some benefits derived from methods that focus on learning grammatical or vocabulary information about languages, but they do not work well for fostering reading fluency. This is why many who learn about language struggle to retain vocabulary long term or read a page without the aid of a dictionary and grammar tools.",
		"q_3": "How much do I need to invest into this platform to read?",
		"a_3": "This will depend on your goals, and at our platform we have a wide variety of courses to get you from zero to an independent speaker, to proficient in the areas you want to focus on. The other major factor is how much time you spend with an instructor 1-on-1 or with a group of co-learners because you will learn much better and quicker with an instructor. That said, it will take most learners about 500 hours of time to acquire an independent speaking ability. With the right courses, instructors, and friends this time will fly by!",
		"q_4": "Which course should I choose?",
		"a_4": "This depends on your goals and where you are. If you are completely new to the language or have never learned it with an active approach, it is best to begin with A1 or A2 level courses where you can master the fundamentals. If you have particular interests, check out the course categories or types to see what best matches your needs. There is no wrong choice and new courses are continually being added.",
		"q_5": "Will the course match my learning style?",
		"a_5": "The beauty of this platform is that our conversational methodology works with any human mind because we are all designed to understand and process spoken language. So, you should have minimal difficulty learning in any course, especially if you take advantage of instructor 1-on-1 sessions for personalized support. That said, certain course types are geared towards particular goals, that may be more so or less so aligned with your goals.",
		"q_6": "Am I too old to learn with these courses?",
		"a_6": "Contrary to popular belief, you are never too old to learn a language. In fact, provided you are in good health the older you are the more likely it is you can learn better and faster than younger people. The barrier most adults face is lack of time for conversation, and the difficulty of coordinating schedules with a tutor (compare this with a toddler’s free schedule and tutors!). At our platform we’ve solved this through our conversational methodology and Tutor Match booking system.",
		"q_7": "What kind of instructors is this platform looking for?",
		"a_7": "There is no specific certification or experience required. Rather, we are looking for instructors who are passionate about sharing knowledge with interested learners and are willing to be coached. So, whether you have years of experience with traditional, grammatical methods, or are a new learner of conversational methods, you may qualify to become a certified instructor because we will support you every step of the way.",
		"q_8": "I want to become an instructor or tutor, but I don’t see a course in my expertise. Should I still apply?",
		"a_8": "Absolutely. Our platform enables us to quickly and easily create courses that are tailored to our learners goals. If you have expertise in a particular area, we may be able to work with you to bring it to life. To find out, please apply and we’ll take things from there.",
		"q_9": "My schedule might be changing soon. Should I still apply to become an instructor/tutor?",
		"a_9": "Yes. For both learners and instructors we understand that in today’s world flexible schedules are important for learning. The good news is that our booking system can reflect the times you are available, and we do not require a long term contract or minimum hours to become an instructor. Please apply and let’s get to know how we can help you teach."
