If you’ve ever acquired languages beyond your native one(s), odds are your language knowledge is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between “I know a few phrases” and “I’m natively fluent.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">To solve this problem organizations have created frameworks to help people more accurately measure and compare their level with others. By far the most common standard internationally is the CEFR, which stands for the</span><a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/the-cefr-descriptors" target="_blank" style="font-size:11pt;color:#15c">Common European Framework of Reference</a><span style="font-size:11pt">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FTXjqNfxvSHsYMtOLSFmZN9h7CwpfvygT2yIzD5nGSepyutqOIH_C5aOiSE2XbPjHh0QAOsoRUSxXcPQF6DBq88olWC6WGeMHsLp5UGO3W1oF3M0XWghwYCCvZg1rhjKpbjXPfSXbXBTWCrEfNbNrNo" height="261" width="328"></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Even though it was created by the Council of Europe and of course it’s no perfect scale, this framework can apply for any spoken language to compare levels of fluency, which is why we use it here at Immersio.</span></p><p><br></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">What Are the CEFR Levels?</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt;background-color:transparent">T</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#111827;background-color:transparent">he CEFR has six proficiency levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2), with A1 referring to total beginners and C2 referring to (near) native fluency.

It depends on what “knowing a language” means. Does it mean being able to say enough phrases to get by as a tourist? Does it mean being able to read literary works with a dictionary in hand? Does it mean being able to carry on a conversation about everyday topics?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">See my article here on all the different parts of knowing a language. And see my article here on how you can measure your fluency in a language.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">The truth is we all learn languages with different goals and motivations, which makes everyone’s personal language learning journey unique. Nevertheless, there are patterns that emerge when you study how people learn languages. And what is common to</span><em style="font-size:11pt">all</em><span style="font-size:11pt">language learning journeys (and even learning in general) is this:</span></p><p class="ql-align-center"><span style="font-size:11pt">Acquiring a language</span><em style="font-size:11pt">only</em><span style="font-size:11pt">comes through “repeated, meaningful, use”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">This is to say, knowing a language comes through “repetition”, which has been called the mother of learning, so not just one or two exposures. Knowing a language comes through “meaningful” experiences, because it is these that our brain is wired to remember. And knowing a language comes through active “use”, whether this happens as we listen and read to receive it, or as we speak and write to produce it.</span></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">Making use of Immersive, Multimodal, Comprehensible Input (IMCI)</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Every aspect of the Immersio experience is razor focused on providing learners with repeated, meaningful, use of any language. This is why Immersio courses get you to digitally immerse yourself in a cultural environment where the language is used. This is why all Immersio lessons are based on contextual conversations about topics that are relevant to your goals. This is why Immersio connects learners with qualified tutors and co-learners so that you can start</span><em style="font-size:11pt">speaking from day one</em><span style="font-size:11pt">and use language as a way to understand and communicate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Whereas other solutions might focus on “quick hacks” or “ninja techniques” (which may have special uses for certain people) at Immersio we focus on fostering true, lasting fluency. We call the method behind the madness of this digital “all-in-one solution” to language learning Immersive, multimodal, comprehensible input, or “IMCI” for short.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">It’s immersive because every course is embedded in a cultural environment with characters who reflect some mindset or worldview.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">It’s multimodal because every course addresses the different modes of language use from reception, production, interaction, or mediation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">It’s comprehensible because every lesson’s dialog is designed to be both</span><em style="font-size:11pt">meaningful</em><span style="font-size:11pt">and</span><em style="font-size:11pt">compelling</em><span style="font-size:11pt">as it builds on your previous knowledge and expands it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">And we use meaningful inputs as every piece of vocabulary, phrases, or grammar is explained in context.</span></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">A High Level Walkthrough of Experiencing IMCI [polyglot tested, and scientifically based]</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Based on applying insights from studies in Second Language Acquisition and best practices in Blended Learning, at Immersio we make it simple to learn and speak any language to the level you want to acquire and learn about the topics you are interested in mastering.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">From a high-level here’s a walk-through of what the IMCI experience is like from any of our Immersio sites or partners.</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Step 1: Enroll in a site’s language and learning path based on your unique goals</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Part of what makes Immersio different is we internally our platform with the razor focus on providing language instructors and organizations with the tools they need to easily expand their language instruction online. What this means is that&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size:11pt">all of the language content you are going to learn comes directly from the people you are going to learn from and interact with, and not some corporate committee. This brings a personal connection and motivation for everyone to see you succeed; and</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt">as a learner you have access to an array of courses that are relevant to what you specifically want to achieve your unique goals. This means no generic content, and a variety of learning sites, languages, and learning paths to choose from.</span></li></ol><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Step 2: Determine your goal and commitment level with your personal tutor</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Different learners have different timelines to work with to achieve their goals. A key factor to succeeding in achieving any goal is to establish a routine until it becomes a habit. This is why after you know what you want to achieve, it’s important to be realistic about your timeline and how much time you are going to commit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">The first key factor is how much time you can dedicate to learning. Perhaps you will be a casual learner as you work full-time and have family to take care of, and so you can commit around 15-30 minutes a day. Perhaps you are doing professional development or are very passionate about what you want to learn and so can commit around 2 hours a day. Or perhaps you have a deadline coming up and want to dedicate yourself to mastering language skills and so can commit around 4 hours a day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">The second key factor is how far you want to go, meaning how many courses you are going to take. Your goal may be to simply have a casual conversation in the language within 2 months so you can travel and experience the culture (A2 level). Your goal may be to become an independent speaker who can read literature in the language and discuss ideas with others without the need to have a dictionary in hand (B2 level). Or your goal may be to function professionally in the language and have access to new work opportunities (C2 level).</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Immersio can connect you with a tutor who can keep you motivated and adapt your goals to a realistic learning plan and tailored schedule so you have the highest chance of success.</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Step 3: Experience the conversations, master the inputs, and practicing speaking with Immy at your own pace</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">With your goals and plan in place, Immersio gets you listening and speaking right away. Every lesson of every course follows a similar flow where you first experience a conversation, then master the “inputs” of each piece of that conversation, and finally practice speaking about what you learned with our AI-powered chatbot Immy in our OpenSpeak™ experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">One of the amazing parts of this “all-in-one” language learning experience is whether you have a few minutes while waiting for a bus, or an hour in a cozy corner, you can pick up your device and learn at your own pace without needing to manage multiple different apps or techniques.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Step 4: Personalize your learning with 121 sessions and our community chat</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">At Immersio we recognize the reality that proper language learning has been too expensive, that learning a language 100% by yourself is not effective, and that the tools available today are not designed to give the right blend of human interaction and self-study.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">This is why we have built into the platform the ability to learn “121” with instructors and qualified tutors to personalize your learning, and also chat with other co-learners in our “Community Chat” spaces. Who knows, you might find yourself making new friends and connections from around the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">And what’s so beautiful about learning with qualified Immersio tutors is not only the flexible scheduling and ability to choose a tutor who best aligns with your needs, but also that every session is based directly on the specific lessons and courses you are learning. This means less time for you and your tutor figuring out what you want to do, and more time answering your questions and applying the content to your situation.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">Start Speaking Today</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt">If you have language learning goals, become a member today and enroll at an Immersio site.

      content: `<p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">If you want to learn or teach a language, a common question is: “How many languages do you know?” But what does it even mean to “know” a language, let alone know anything?&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">What you need to know</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt">There’s no simple answer for this. This is because knowing a language is more than understanding a large vocabulary list. If it were, all you would need to do is memorize a deck of flashcards and then you’d be fluent. Knowing a language is more than understanding how the grammar works. If it were, you could read and study all the grammar rules, as if they were universal, and then be able to communicate. And knowing a language is more than just the very language itself. If it were, there would be no need to understand anything about the history, culture, or people of a given language community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">The reality is knowing a language means some combination of all these aspects and how they relate. So, here’s my list of what you need to know (to some degree) to say you “know a language”.</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Lexical Knowledge (many, many words)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: ball, person, they, can</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Morpholexical Knowledge (how new words are created)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: redo, truth-iness, underanalyze</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Morphological Knowledge (the different forms words can take)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: table or tables, speak or speaking, I or me, let’s or let us</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Grammatical Knowledge (the different kinds of words there are)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: noun, adjective, pronoun, verb</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Syntactic Knowledge (how various kinds of words work together)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: I’m giving her a ball, what do you think?</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Idiomatic Knowledge (common expressions and their structure)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: without further ado, keep an eye on him, you made me do it, a big new comfy black couch</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Pragmatic Knowledge (what is often implied, but not explicitly stated)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: guess what?, that taco looks delicious, want to get a cup of coffee?, forceps!</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt">Discourse Knowledge (the kinds of contexts certain language is used in)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example: once upon a time, ladies and gentlemen, don’t forgot to hit subscribe</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Note that this list doesn’t address how a spoken language can be “performed” in different ways, such as how it can be pronounced, heard, written, read, signed, texted, or similar.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">Mapping Linguistic Knowledge</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt">All the types of knowledge mentioned above are also related to each other in certain ways. The following image illustrates this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/UKIhEdks6-UovDaogedG2zeyW78A2hLZOPIpW8x2opyF7d_TE3crV8uvt7Be2aOSVGze20t2SfrzbiLVI18dcygcBtqp5GfrPpnW4XJaBrSAW5d5zi3PF8lQB9Ansqrwvy7DmAxmhXmlphRT2Yax5uM" height="351" width="624"></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Let me explain. We’ll begin with the two axes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">The vertical axis represents a continuum from specific to schematic. “Specific” refers to having a limited or well-defined meaning, and “schematic” refers to having a broader or abstracted meaning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">The horizontal axis represents a continuum from simple to composite, that is having few parts to having many parts. With this in mind, let’s talk through why each kind of language knowledge is positioned where it is.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Lexical&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Lexical knowledge refers to the simplest and most specific parts of language, that is, the individual words you find in a dictionary. Technically, the different word entries you find in a dictionary are called “lexemes”. The reason for using this technical term is because many different forms of a “word” can refer to one and the same “word” (= lexeme). For example, in English the “words” (= forms) am, be, was, were, being are all the same “word” (= lexeme). And technically, the specific “word” (= form) that is chosen to represent the lexeme in a dictionary is called the “lemma”. It’s simply convention that determines what the lemma is.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">When you begin to learn a language, the primary focus is learning more and more lexemes.</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Morpholexical</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">As you get more schematic (and perhaps slightly more composite), the next kind of knowledge is morpholexical, that is, how words are created.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example, it’s one thing to know the lexeme “study” (as a verb), but it’s another thing to understand how “study”, “studious”, “study hall”, and the nouns “studies” are related to each other. How you take the “root” -stud and form different words refers to morpholexical knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Here it’s useful to know what a “morpheme” is. A morpheme is the simplest meaningful “part” of a linguistic expression. For example, look at the word “undeniable”. This word contains the parts un- + deny + -able, which are each called morphemes. The morpheme un- makes something negative and is always bound to other morphemes. The morpheme deny is a lexeme that refers to declaring something to not be so. And the morpheme -able is always bound to other morphemes and refers to an attribute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">As you learn a language, recognizing how different morphemes come together to forms different lexemes is key to quickly acquiring more vocabulary.</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Morphological</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Very similar to morpholexical, but still distinct, is morphological knowledge. This knowledge refers to the different forms a word can take.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example, in English you say “she walks” with the form -s, whereas you say “they walk” without the -s. Here “walk” and “walks” are different forms of the same word (= lexeme).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">Some languages can be difficult to acquire because they have a very complex system of forms compared to others, and others languages will have very many irregular forms to internalize.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Grammatical&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">This takes us to grammatical knowledge, which is the most schematic, yet simple kind of language knowledge. Grammatical language here refers to the different types of words a language has.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example, due to the way our human minds work, it’s universal for languages to have “nouns” that refer to “things”, and “verbs” that refer to processes or relationships. And most languages have words like “and” “but” “or” to link thoughts together, and words like “of” “from” “with” to link certain kinds of words together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">As you learn another language, it’s important to understand the various kinds of words there are, even if you can’t always give it a label.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Idiomatic</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">If you look at the horizontal axis, the most specific kind of composite knowledge is idiomatic. Like lexemes, so-called “idioms” in a language have a specific, defined meaning, but unlike lexemes they are composite because there are more parts (= morphemes).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">When you learn a language it can be difficult to recognize and understand idioms at first because the meaning is not obvious from the sum of the parts. For example, in English the idiom “to kick the bucket” refers to someone dying, which has nothing to do with the action of kicking and nothing to do with things we call buckets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">This unpredictable nature of idioms can make learning a language difficult, especially since many language learning reference sources like dictionaries, grammars, or phrasebooks don’t capture idioms well. Nevertheless, they are very important to master because idioms exist because they are commonly used.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Discourse</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">As you get more schematic you approach what is called discourse knowledge. This refers to the different contexts that language is used in. As you learn a language, it’s important to keep in mind that certain lexemes and idioms have different meanings in different contexts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example, if you hear the phrase “ladies and gentlemen”, it may evoke the beginning of a sporting event. If you hear the phrase “once upon a time” you know you are hearing the beginning of a story. And if you hear someone say “don’t forget to like and subscribe,” what context can you imagine other than a video on Social Media?</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">So, when you learn a language, it’s important to be aware of the different contexts you are in, because how words and idioms are used in one may vary greatly from another.</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Pragmatic</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">In the middle of the chart we have pragmatic knowledge, which is closely related to discourse knowledge. This refers to how context determines the meaning of language. Many times it refers to meaning that is implied, especially with so-called “incomplete sentences”.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example, if you hear someone say: “Guess what?” you are not likely being asked to give an answer, but rather prepare to hear some surprising news. Or if a surgeon says “forceps!”, they are most likely asking for an assistant to hand them forceps to perform an operation, even though they are not using a verb.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">When learning a language, it’s important to learn with tutors or instructors who make sure you understand what is implied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16pt">Syntactic</span></h2><p><span style="font-size:11pt">As you get more and more schematic there is syntactic knowledge, which is technically called “syntax”. This refers to how different words work together to form more composite units, like phrases and sentences. Admittedly, one might consider this to also be grammatical knowledge, but it’s useful to distinguish the two.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">For example, let’s take the example sentence: “David is giving Jeff Mark’s book.” Who’s the person doing the giving? David. Who’s receiving the book? Jeff. Whose book is it? Mark’s. You know this as an English speaker because you have internalized the syntax.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">When you are beginning to learn a language it can be difficult to understand the syntax because it is indeed the most composite and schematic aspect of a language. This is why a common beginner's question is: “Why do you say it this way?” The short answer is “Because that’s how you say it.” And the longer answers tend to be explaining the syntax and concepts like “word order” or “object”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">So, don’t worry about mastering syntax at the beginning of a language learning journey. As you first expose yourself to many words, forms, and types of expressions, you will inherently learn the syntax piece by piece.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="font-size:20pt">Putting it all together</span></h1><p><span style="font-size:11pt">To sum things up, knowing a language can refer to very different kinds of knowledge. And to become truly fluent it’s important to learn each one of them</span><em style="font-size:11pt">to some degree</em><span style="font-size:11pt">. Unfortunately, many language learning solutions just don’t work because they might focus on a few areas and do them really well, but they omit others, which leaves gaps in your knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">If you want to learn about how you measure fluency in a language, check out our article</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOnLjiwI9bJHCzb_dVfLb1EzCd2wqJWS_DF29fuTz5U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="font-size:11pt;color:#15c">here</a><span style="font-size:11pt">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt">To address this “gap” problem Immersio provides all its instructors and tutors, and in turn learners, with a platform that makes sure that every kind of knowledge mentioned above is addressed.
